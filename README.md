# JavasScript Coding Quiz

## Description

This is my first attempt at creating a 'game'/'quiz' while building a web-application. My purpose for this game is to test my knowledge as well as upcoming developers' over all things JavaScript related. I plan on adding more questions in the future.

Hope you enjoy!

## Usage

To use this application, you will need to click the "Start Game" button.

- This will prompt the first out of four multiple choice questions, while simutaniously starting the countdown of the game clock (which counts down from 90 seconds).

- If the question is answered correctly, you are transitioned to the next question, as well as gain '100 points' to your score.

- If the question is answered incorrectly, you are transitioned to the next question, as well as lose 15 seconds from the game clock. (You gain no points)

- The game is over if you either answer all of the questions, or if the game clock reaches "0" seconds.

- Once game is over, you are show your score. You are also askedto click a button if you would like to save your score.

- If user opts to save their score, they are transitioned to a form to enter their initials.

- Once they submit the form (their initials), their initials followed by their score is shown below.
